    <p>Salmon is readily available, extremely versatile and simply delicious. Here we cover salmon basics from weeknight fillets to weekend entertaining: the cuts and types to buy, equipment youâ€™ll need, essential methods for preparing it and sauces for dressing it up.</p>
<h2>Ingridients:</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Salmon fillet</li>
</ul>
<h3>The process:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Lay your salmon fillet flat on a board or on a sheet of foil on your counter, skin side down (even if there is no skin). Run your hand across the surface of the fish. You will feel a ridge of the tiny bones sticking up.

        Starting at the thickest end of the fillet, use needle-nose pliers to grab the tip of the bone and firmly yank it out. There may be as many as 20 of these bones in a whole fillet.</li>
    <li>
        Heat your oven to 400 degrees. Place the fillets skin-side down on a lightly oiled, foil-lined sheet pan. Season them with salt and pepper and whatever else pleases you: Chinese five-spice powder, perhaps, or a mixture of brown sugar and mustard.</li>
    <li> Slide the pan into the top half of your oven. The fillets should be cooked to medium in about 12 minutes.</li>

<h2>Ingridients:</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>The sharp flavor of raw onions adds flavor depth to the marinade and pairs well with the meat. Make sure to thinly slice them!</li>
    <li>Lemon Juice: This ingredient is crucial, as it helps tenderize the beef for shawarma. It also adds a bright, zesty flavor.</li>
    <li>Olive Oil: You will need some olive oil in the marinade and some to saut√© the meat. Olive oil has a nice, rich flavor and a high smoke point, which is excellent for use on the stovetop.</li>
    <li>Shawarma Seasoning Blend: You will need a variety of spices for the marinade, such as cumin, cayenne, turmeric, and paprika. However, there are others, too, so be sure to check out the recipe card for all of them.</li>
    <li>Beef: For this beef recipe, I used top sirloin steak. Make sure to cut it against the grain and create similar-sized strips so they cook evenly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The process:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Combine the marinade ingredients in a bowl. Ensure the shawarma spice blend is evenly distributed.</li>
    <li>Add the beef. Toss the sliced beef with the marinade to coat it.</li>
    <li> Cover and marinate the beef in the refrigerator.</li>
    <li>Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef in a single layer.</li>
    <li>Cook the beef until done- about 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Transfer the cooked beef to a plate and cover with foil until ready to serve.</li>
